## Docker introduction
Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications.

# Docker advantages
for
# Continuous Delivery

!SUB
## Faster
- Slow one-time events happen only once on _image_ creation, not on _instance_ creation
- Creating instances is fast/cheap

!NOTE
One-time example initialisation of the app has to happen just once. Fort example for test and production, same artifact is started which had it's initialization done @ build time

!SUB
## Better
- Same images used for development and production
- Isolation
- Consistent and reproducible results
- Portable/host-independent
- Scalability

!SUB
## And more:
- Encourages collaboration between Dev and Ops
- Version control of your Docker images
- Share your images using the Docker Hub
